Implementations of Hybrid Brain Computer Interface Methods
==========================================================

This repository contains Hybrid BCI methods that can be used to simultaneously
decode EEG and EEG signals for brain computer interfaces (BCIs). Some of the
models depend on the functionality that is provided by ``gumpy``, a python
toolbox which contains several signal and feature processing routines that are
commonly used for BCIs.
